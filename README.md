# Orphan Bot

Hi! Meet Orphan Bot. Orphan Bot was built to assist the members of The Orphans guild in Black Desert Online. Orphan Bot was written with the power of [Discord.Py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and the help of [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)! 

Planned functionality for Orphan Bot is listed below. 

### Planned Functionality
- World Boss Reminders (NA EST)
